# Simple Calculator App

This project is a simple calculator app developed using React Native for the Mobile Computing course at Iqra National University. The app was developed by Ahmed Junaid (ID: 15815) under the supervision of Sir Asfandyar.

The app demonstrates the use of React Native to create a user-friendly interface with buttons for each number and operator.

## Why React Native instead of PhoneGap?

1. Native performance: React Native compiles to native code, resulting in better performance compared to PhoneGap.
2. Native UI components: React Native uses native UI components, providing a more native look and feel to the app.
3. Large community and ecosystem: React Native has a large and active community, which means more resources, libraries, and support.
4. Hot Reloading: React Native supports hot reloading, making it easier and faster to see changes during development.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js and npm: Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/. This will also install npm (Node Package Manager), which is required for installing React Native and other dependencies.
2. Install Expo CLI: Run the following command to install Expo CLI globally:

```bash

npm install -g expo-cli

```

## How to run the project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
